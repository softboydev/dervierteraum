In today's era, even the most basic thing we have - our identity - is no longer certain<br><br>A few months ago, when I was living in Hamburg, my identity was stolen.<br><br>For the following 24 hours, I was distraught. I felt that the most basic thing I have, my identity, was being stripped away from me.<br><br>While I was deeply disturbed by the thought of someone else claiming to be me and doing things under my name, I was also curious as to how it could happen.<br><br>I decided to start researching.<br><br>The project Identity Crisis is the result of that research. It is divided into 3 parts, each is a question that has accompanied me throughout the ordeal.<br><br>1. Is it possible to produce something that sounds exactly like me?<br>2. Is it possible to produce something that looks, and sounds like me?<br>3. How much information about me is accessible at any given time?<br><br>This project is done using artificial intelligence, the character I created sounds like me and looks like me, but none of this is real.
