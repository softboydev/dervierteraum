Soft maps attempts to re-build tools for navigation and orientation by looking at mapping through an alternative lens. Here, a swimming pool is our working model, and the act of cleaning the pool becomes an algorithm for mapping. We explore how tools and presence shape maps, forming a multi-perspective map & score that questions conventional cartographic practices. It matters which maps map maps.
