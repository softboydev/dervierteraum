riconoscersi attimi sospesi di fragilità in divenire disturba tells a visual and auditive story, mostly metaphorical, which uses and combines various media, as well as supports, in an attempt to tear the veil of the obvious in order to probe the inner abysses of the human being and investigate its fragility. It is an invitation to embark on a journey, it is a way to go throughout the existential labyrinth. Its purpose is to expose and disarm the viewer which, getting lost, can rediscover his own negative capability: stay in uncertainties, mysteries and doubts without being impatient to arrive at facts and reasons.<br><br>It is a rare opportunity to loosen the curtain, to go beyond the declared world, to travel through unexplored universes which could awaken asleep questions. May it is possible to find some answers or truths if the limit is inhabited without reserve. It is the beginning of a journey, it is an ode to vulnerability. It’s a hope for our own awareness in order to be able to act in the future and rise again.
