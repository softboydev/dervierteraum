"Invisible Cities" presents five artistic perspectives which explore the relationship between the virtual world and the built environment.<br><br>The gap between tactical as well as mytho-logical model and its realizations is bridged through conceptual approaches to lens-based media, installation, sculpture, and video.<br><br>In an attempt to reflect upon and deconstruct future visions proposed by politics, economics, and technology for urban living, the exhibition navigates the mediation of the construction of thought, augmented space and its real world parameters.<br><br>By analyzing various facets of the threshold between the social and the private, the virtual and the symbolic, such a project lastly seeks to reproach those tendencies which have brought  it into place, whilst and through transforming them, suggesting an extension, beyond sight.
