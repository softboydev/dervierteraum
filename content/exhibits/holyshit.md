Holy Shit is a collection of digital paintings developing from the idea of escapism.<br><br>They are set in the bathroom, a place where we can disappear, collect our thoughts, take a breath from the chaotic madness of our surroundings.<br><br>The bathroom has a unique power, a transformative space in which we shed parts of ourselves â€” literally and metaphorically.<br><br>It is a sacred place where we can live out our violent, sad, happy and imagined fantasies releasing our most inner thoughts.
